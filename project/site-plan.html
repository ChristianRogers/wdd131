      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose is to communicate which items are the best at McDonald's and
        Burger King. A person could navigate to this site to get a quick idea of
        what to order at either restaurant.
      </p>
      <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People interested in food and my opinion on them</p>
      <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
      <p>
        The rankings will be stored as an object within an array. I'll use ES
        Modules to import the data into the main JavaScript file. Then I'll use
        javascript to loop through the data and generate the HTML needed to show
        the top 10. I'll use event listeners for buttons to filter so if a user
        hit the "breakfast" button, they would only see those from the top 10
        that are from the breakfast menu.
      </p>

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL:
      <a href="https://coolors.co/a4303f-d87e3e-f2d0a4-ffeccc" target="_blank"
        >https://coolors.co/a4303f-d87e3e-f2d0a4-ffeccc</a
      >

      <table class="colors">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>Primary</th>
            <th>Secondary</th>
            <th>Accent 1</th>
            <th>Accent 2</th>
          </tr>
          <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
          <tr>
            <td class="primary">[#A4303F]</td>
            <td class="secondary">[#D87E3E]</td>

            <td class="accent2">[#FFECCC]</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      </h4>
      <h4>

      <h3>Navigation</h3>
      <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Home page [McDonalds]</h3>
      <img src="images/mcd/bigmac.avif" alt="Big Mac" />
      <p>McDonald's classic burger, largely carried by the sauce</p>
      <img src="images/mcd/mcdfries.avif" alt="McDonald's Fries" />
      <p>
        World famous fries that are crispy and salty, but absolutely terrible
        cold
      </p>
      <img src="images/mcd/coke.avif" alt="Coke" />
      <p>Perhaps the only Coke to rival the Mexican version with real sugar</p>
      <img src="images/mcd/filet.avif" alt="Filet o fish" />
      <p>A surprisingly good fish sandwich that is underrated</p>
      <img src="images/mcd/mcdicecream.avif" alt="McDonald's Ice Cream" />
      <p>Great, granted the machine is working :/</p>
      <img src="images/mcd/hashbrown.avif" alt="Hashbrown" />
      <p>A staple of McDonald's breakfast</p>
      <img src="images/mcd/mcgriddle.avif" alt="Breakfast Sandwich" />
      <p>
        Sweet and savory breakfast sandwich, way better than the Muffin or
        Biscuit variation
      </p>
      <img src="images/mcd/qpc.avif" alt="Quarter Pounder" />
      <p>The one burger at McDonald's that is made with fresh beef</p>
      <img src="images/mcd/spicychicken.avif" alt="Spicy Chicken" />
      <p>Miles better than the much more expensive McCrispy</p>
      <img src="images/mcd/bagel.avif" alt="Bagel" />
      <p>Surprisingly good breakfast option, about on par with the McGriddle</p>

      <h3>Burger King</h3>
      <img src="images/bk/whopper.avif" alt="Whopper" />
      <p>
        Burger King's signature burger, larger than most other fast food burgers
      </p>
      <img src="images/bk/fries.avif" alt="Burger King Fries" />
      <p>Decent, and seem to hold up better after time</p>
      <img src="images/bk/chickenfries.avif" alt="chicken fries" />
      <p>Better than expected, especially with a good sauce</p>
      <img src="images/bk/chickensandwich.avif" alt="Chicken Sandwich" />
      <p>
        Probably the best among the traditional fast food chicken sandwiches
      </p>
      <img src="images/bk/onion.avif" alt="Onion Rings" />
      <p>Better than average onion rings, a good alternative to fries</p>
      <img src="images/bk/chickenjr.webp" alt="Chicken Jr" />
      <p>A solid small chicken sandwich, better than McDonald's equivalent</p>
      <img src="images/bk/croissant.webp" alt="Croissant" />
      <p>A unique breakfast sandwich, that holds up well</p>
      <img src="images/bk/doublebacon.avif" alt="Double Bacon Burger" />
      <p>A great burger for bacon lovers</p>
      <img src="images/bk/frozendrink.avif" alt="Frozen Drink" />
      <p>A good alternative to soda, especially on a hot day</p>
      <img src="images/bk/hashbrowns.webp" alt="Hashbrowns" />
      <p>Solid hashbrowns, comparable to Chick-fil-A</p>

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
        here
      </p>

      <h3>McDonalds</h3>
      <p>
        The idea here is that each of the top 10 items will be generated via
        JavaScript from an array of objects. Each item will have an image, a
        title, and a short description. There will also be buttons at the top to
        filter by whether the item is from the breakfast or the lunch/dinner
        menu.
      </p>
      <img src="images/wireframe1.jpg" alt="home page wireframe" />

      <h3>Burger King</h3>
      <p>
        In concept, this is familiar to the other page, but to differentiate it,
        instead of displaying the items all at once, it will display one at a
        time with "next" and "previous" buttons to cycle through them.
